# React Scan Inspector

## How It Works

React Scan Inspector automatically detects React applications and monitors their performance in real-time. When enabled, it will:

- Track component render times
- Identify unnecessary re-renders
- Log performance insights to the console
- Highlight optimization opportunities

1. Click the extension icon in your toolbar
2. If React is detected on the current page, you'll see an indicator
3. Toggle scanning on/off using the switch
